1)`charles proxy ?- charles proxy is a network debuging tool.helps in understanding the content in your network call.
i.e request sent to server 
and data fetched from server


2)sanity testing ?- its a type of testing which is used to quickly evaluate the basic functionaly of the 
new software build is working correctly or not


3)smoke testing ?- also called as build verification testing or confidence testing which is used to check that the 
new software build is ready for the next testing phase

4)diff b/w smoke and sanity?
smoke testing verifies that the build is stable enouh for further testing

sanity testing used to check whether the specific functionality or 
component is working as expected after a change or modification

word = "vaishali"
word1 = word[slice(0,8,3)] #vsl   start , stop, increment value
print(word1)

5)#slice is a function to get the sequence of elements in the given range

 
6)memory allocation in python 
----------------------------
:- we can see the location of memory allocation of that value 
using id() function

eg: butter = 5
    id(butter)   #78901288789

7) alerts in selenium
-------------------

driver.switchto().alert.getText()
driver.switchto().alert.accept()
driver.switchto().alert().dismiss()


8) switch from one window to another
--------------------------------------

driver.switchto().window(window id)

driver.getwindowhandle() - current window
driver.getwindowhandles() - all open windows


9) assert and verify
-------------------

assert(hard assert)
if the condition fails , the execution will stop immediately and the test method will be failed

syntax : Assert.assertEquals(Actual,Expected)

verify (soft assert)

even if the condition fails , the execution will continue

syntax: softAssert.assertEquals(Actual,Expected)


10) what is ur criteria for Automation?say if you have 500 testcase , which one will you pick first?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
first we need to see the priority which ever testcase has high priority , we can filter that first
if incase all the testcase have the same priority , we can take the testcases which are covering the 
major functionalities

who is responsible for .exe file browsers or selenium?
browsers

11) driver.close()-
--------------
this command is used to close the current browser window which has focus.in case the browser has open only one window open
then this command will quit the entire browser session

driver.quit()-
----------------
driver.quit() is used to quit the whole browser session


12) how to handle multiple windows in selenium?
--------------------------------------------

getWindowHandle():- with this method , we can get the unique id of the current window

getWindowHandles() :- This will return a Set of string .this gives the window ids of all the open windows

switchto() :- this method is used to perform switch operations b/w windows
               driver.switchto().window(windowid)


Set<String> s1 = driver.getWindowHandles();

Iterator<String> i1 = s1.iterator();

while (i1.hasNext())
{
String child = i1.next();
  if(!mainwindow.equalsIgnoreCase(childwindow))
  {
    driver.switchto().window(child)
  }
}


13) maximize window:
-------------------
driver.manage().window().maximize();


14) IFRAMES
-------------:

its a kind of frame which is embedded in another webpage .this iframe is defined with a tag <iframe>

way to find frames in a webpage

driver.findelements(By.tagname("iframe")).size()

we can switch between frames using:
index,name or id, webelement

driver.switchto().frame()


15) explain about your project and roles and responsibilities:
----------------------------------------------------------------

hi,this is vaishali here, I am having 7+ years of IT Experience in testing.Majorily into Automation testing
my current roles and responsibilities were taking ownership of the platform module of our Application.will  regularly 
be a part of sprint planning which lasts for 30 days.interms of Automation , majorily involved into Test Automation
activities.we are having the existing framework and will be converting the manual test cases into Automated ones
Mobile automation Appium Selenium is current project


16) heap : heap data structure is used to represent the priority queue . in python , its available using heapq module

heapq.heapify(li) - This is used to convert iterable into heap

heapq.heappush(heap,ele) : this function is used to insert the elements to a heap

heapq.heappop(li): this will remove and return the smallest element from the heap

17) if you have given a requirement , what are the factors you consider for Automation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) scope - it is not practically possible to automate every testcase
1) i will be doing the manual testing for the testcase to check the stability of the functionality.
2) any dependancies in setting up the precondition or any challenges in test data
3)how frequently the testcase is going tto be used ie all the major functionalities should be covered first in Automation


18) how to find the total webelements present in a webpage?


driver.findelements(By.xpath("//*"))- returns a list containing all the webelements present in a webpage


19) Total number of text boxes in a webpage
------------------------------------------

driver.findelements(By.classname("")).size()


20) pom.xml
----------

Project Object Model

it comtains groupid , artifact id , jars, plugins, dependancies

name - project name 
url - project url

21)In jenkins , when the build triggers, where the execution will happen?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
jenkins features a groovy script console


22) what is a test plan
--------------------

test paln is the detailed document that has test strategies, objectives, schedule. estimation , deadline , 
resource required to complete the project



23) what is software testing lifecycle
----------------------------------

STLC is a systematic approach to test a software application and to ensure that the application is free from defects.

The main goal of STLC is to identify and document any defect or issue in the application as early as possible in the 
development process.

stages:

Test Planning
Test Analysis
Test Design
Test Environment setup
Test Execution
Test closure
Defect Retesting




24) xpath and sibiling xpath 
----------------------------
sibling xpath = //tagname[@attr = 'Value']/following-sibling::*

//tagname[@attr = 'Value']/preceding-sibling::*
        

Example of child xpath = //*[@class = "menu-card-content"]//*[@class = "PriceVegNonveg"]

dynamic xpath
--------------

1)using contains
- it can be written using contains keyword which has the ability to find the element with partial text

//*[contains(@class , 'sub')]

2) usind or & and

//*[@name = "priya" or @type = "student"]
//*[@name = "priya" and @type = "student"]

3) using starts-with  - //*[starts-with(@id , "message")]

4) using text() = //*[text() = 'value']


25) how to ensure that the page is fully loaded
---------------------------------------------

document.readyState() property

document refers to any webpage that is loaded in the browser.

represents the current state of the page loading process

this has three values 

loading - the page is loading

interactive - page loading is done but sub resources like images , frames , stylesheets may still be loading

complete - page loading is done including subresource

26)how to find the broken links in a webpage
----------------------------------------------

4XX - refers to client side error
5XX - refers to server response error

On a webpage , hyperlinks are implemented using anchor tags <a>

step 1-use <a> tag to fetch all the links present on a webapge
step 2- send hhtp request for the link
step 3 - verify the http response code for the link
step 4 - determine whether the link is valid or invalid based on the http response code

another way is clicking the link and getting the title of the webpage




27)if an element is dynamic how will you locate it?
------------------------------------------------

dynamic testing : elements on a webpage with attributes or properties that can change dynamically during run time i.e may 
change each time when the page is loaded.

we can use contains, starts-with , ends-with



28)Agile methodology
----------------------

Agile is a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasize contionuous 
collabration and improvement.Team follows a cycle of planning , executing, evaluating.

we will use this for the project to reach the target and we have daily scrum and updating what has done yesterday ,
will be doing today , to be done tomorrow

29)role of scrum master
-----------------------
creating and onboarding project teams and integrating them into organization 
and providing clear vision of the product.Also ensures that the meeting happens daily


30)how to ensure 100% testing
-------------------------------

having all the requirements at the early stage i.e all the modules which should undero testing.and keepin the change in the 
requirements minimal or if possible we can avoid it as well.




31)constructor-
---------------
constructor is a block whose name is same name as class name and it will be called when the instance of the class 
is created.we can also pass parameters in constructor. if we didn't create any constructor , the class will have its 
default constructor.It is used to set the initial values for the object attributes.


public class Main
{
  int x;

  public Main()
  {
     int x = 10;
  }

}



32)static
---------------
static is a keyword which is mainly used memory management.

It is used to share the same variable or a method of the given class .this keyword can be used with variable , method , 
block or a nested class.

the static keyword is used for a constant variable and if a method is declared as static it cannot be overridden.
these are belons to the class rather than the object of the class

when a block is decalared as static , it will be executed only once when the class gets loaded and before the main method 
execution

A class can be declared as static only if its a nested class.we cannot declare a top level class with  a static modifier

33)how to read the contents in a table in selenium
-----------------------------------------------------

driver.find_elements_by_xpath("//table/tbody/tr")  - will give the row data in selenium

driver.find_elements_by_xpath("//table/tbody/tr[1]/th") - column headers in a table


34) how to find a broken images in a webpage
--------------------------------------------------

driver.findelements(By.tagname("img"))

if (img.getAttribute("naturalWidth").equals("0"))
{
	System.out.println(img.getAttribute("outerHTML") + " is broken.");
      iBrokenImageCount++;
}


35) can we create instance for abstract class
----------------------------------------------

Abstract class cannot be instantiated

36)interface
---------------

Interface is a blueprint of a class.Its a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
it has only abstract methods and static variables.
by interface , we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
interface fields are public static final and methods are public abstract by default

interface MyInterface
{
void print();
}

37) final
-----------
final is a keyword in java which is used to restrict the user.
It can be used in variable , method and class.
the blank final variables can be initialized in the constructor only.the blank final varible can be 
static also which will be initialized in the static block only

if you make the variable as final, you cannot change the value of the variable.it will be constant.
if you make a method as final , it cannot be overridden.
if you make any class as final , you cannot extend it


38)Exception
-----------------

if there is any interruption in the execution of the normal flow of the program,then Exception will occur.
All Exceptions are subclasses of the class throwable.
It will be handled using try catch block

try
{
}
catch(Exception e)
{
}

stale element Exeption:
---------------------------
Its a runtime error, by the time the code uses an object in the webpage and the state of the object changes
at that time.

Webdriver Exception:
--------------------

driver is trying to switch to invalid or non existing alert popup

session not found Exception :
----------------------------------

driver is trying to perform operation on webpage after the browser is closed or browser session not available







Testng framework
-----------------
It is a open source automation framework for Java.NG  satnds for Next generation

annoations 
-------------

@BeforeMethod  - This method will be executed before every method
@AfterMethod  - This method will be executed after every  method
@BeforeClass - this will execute before the first @test method in the class . it will be executed only once
@AfterClass - this willl get execute after all the @test in the class
@BeforeTest - this will be executed before the @Test method.it will be executed multiple times
@AfterTest - this will be executed after the @Test method. it will be executed multiple times
@BeforeSuite - This will run before all the tests in the suites executes
@AfterSuite - This will run after all the tests in the suites executes

why testNG
-------------

It makes the frmework more structured, readable , user friendly


how to group the testcase
---------------------------

@Test(groups = {"Smoke Test"})

how to priortize the testcase
----------------------------
@Test(enabled = false)

Blackbox testing
----------------

blackbox testing is a testing performed by the testers where they are not concerned about the internal knowledge 
and the implementation details of the application but rather focusing on validating the functionality based on 
provided specification and requirements.

categories of blackbox testing
-------------------------------
*functional - detemines functionality of the software
*regression - the newly added code should not affect the existing code
*nonfunctional - it doesn't involves the functional testing . it focuses on software performace , scalability
                 and usability 



how to disable the testcase testng
--------------------------------------
@Test(enabled = false)
