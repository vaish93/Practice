1)`charles proxy ?- charles proxy is a network debuging tool.helps in understanding the content in your network call.
i.e request sent to server 
and data fetched from server


2)sanity testing ?- its a type of testing which is used to quickly evaluate the basic functionaly of the 
new software build is working correctly or not


3)smoke testing ?- also called as build verification testing or confidence testing which is used to check that the 
new software build is ready for the next testing phase

4)diff b/w smoke and sanity?
smoke testing verifies that the build is stable enouh for further testing

sanity testing used to check whether the specific functionality or 
component is working as expected after a change or modification

word = "vaishali"
word1 = word[slice(0,8,3)] #vsl   start , stop, increment value
print(word1)

5)#slice is a function to get the sequence of elements in the given range

 
6)memory allocation in python 
----------------------------
:- we can see the location of memory allocation of that value 
using id() function

eg: butter = 5
    id(butter)   #78901288789

7) alerts in selenium
-------------------

driver.switchto().alert.getText()
driver.switchto().alert.accept()
driver.switchto().alert().dismiss()


8) switch from one window to another
--------------------------------------

driver.switchto().window(window id)

driver.getwindowhandle() - current window
driver.getwindowhandles() - all open windows


9) assert and verify
-------------------

assert(hard assert)
if the condition fails , the execution will stop immediately and the test method will be failed

syntax : Assert.assertEquals(Actual,Expected)

verify (soft assert)

even if the condition fails , the execution will continue

syntax: softAssert.assertEquals(Actual,Expected)


10) what is ur criteria for Automation?say if you have 500 testcase , which one will you pick first?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
first we need to see the priority which ever testcase has high priority , we can filter that first
if incase all the testcase have the same priority , we can take the testcases which are covering the 
major functionalities

who is responsible for .exe file browsers or selenium?
browsers

11) driver.close()-
--------------
this command is used to close the current browser window which has focus.in case the browser has open only one window open
then this command will quit the entire browser session

driver.quit()-
----------------
driver.quit() is used to quit the whole browser session


12) how to handle multiple windows in selenium?
--------------------------------------------

getWindowHandle():- with this method , we can get the unique id of the current window

getWindowHandles() :- This will return a Set of string .this gives the window ids of all the open windows

switchto() :- this method is used to perform switch operations b/w windows
               driver.switchto().window(windowid)


Set<String> s1 = driver.getWindowHandles();

Iterator<String> i1 = s1.iterator();

while (i1.hasNext())
{
String child = i1.next();
  if(!mainwindow.equalsIgnoreCase(childwindow))
  {
    driver.switchto().window(child)
  }
}


13) maximize window:
-------------------
driver.manage().window().maximize();


14) IFRAMES
-------------:

its a kind of frame which is embedded in another webpage .this iframe is defined with a tag <iframe>

way to find frames in a webpage

driver.findelements(By.tagname("iframe")).size()

we can switch between frames using:
index,name or id, webelement

driver.switchto().frame()


15) explain about your project and roles and responsibilities:
----------------------------------------------------------------

hi,this is vaishali here, I am having 7+ years of IT Experience in testing.Majorily into Automation testing
my current roles and responsibilities were taking ownership of the platform module of our Application.will  regularly 
be a part of sprint planning which lasts for 30 days.interms of Automation , majorily involved into Test Automation
activities.we are having the existing framework and will be converting the manual test cases into Automated ones
Mobile automation Appium Selenium is current project


16) heap : heap data structure is used to represent the priority queue . in python , its available using heapq module

heapq.heapify(li) - This is used to convert iterable into heap

heapq.heappush(heap,ele) : this function is used to insert the elements to a heap

heapq.heappop(li): this will remove and return the smallest element from the heap

17) if you have given a requirement , what are the factors you consider for Automation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) scope - it is not practically possible to automate every testcase
1) i will be doing the manual testing for the testcase to check the stability of the functionality.
2) any dependancies in setting up the precondition or any challenges in test data
3)how frequently the testcase is going tto be used ie all the major functionalities should be covered first in Automation


18) how to find the total webelements present in a webpage?


driver.findelements(By.xpath("//*"))- returns a list containing all the webelements present in a webpage


19) Total number of text boxes in a webpage
------------------------------------------

driver.findelements(By.classname("")).size()


20) pom.xml
----------

Project Object Model

it comtains groupid , artifact id , jars, plugins, dependancies

name - project name 
url - project url

21)In jenkins , when the build triggers, where the execution will happen?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



22) what is a test plan
--------------------

test paln is the detailed document that has test strategies, objectives, schedule. estimation , deadline , 
resource required to complete the project



23) what is software testing lifecycle
----------------------------------

STLC is a systematic approach to test a software application and to ensure that the application is free from defects.

The main goal of STLC is to identify and document any defect or issue in the application as early as possible in the 
development process.

stages:

Test Planning
Test Analysis
Test Design
Test Environment setup
Test Execution
Test closure
Defect Retesting




24) xpath and sibiling xpath
----------------------------


each letter number of duplicates
-------------------------------



25) how to ensure that the page is fully loaded
---------------------------------------------

26)how to find the broken links in a webpage
----------------------------------------------

4XX - refers to client side error
5XX - refers to server response error

On a webpage , hyperlinks are implemented using anchor tags <a>

step 1-use <a> tag to fetch all the links present on a webapge
step 2- send hhtp request for the link
step 3 - verify the http response code for the link
step 4 - determine whether the link is valid or invalid based on the http response code




27)if an element is dynamic how will you locate it?
------------------------------------------------


28)Agile methodology
----------------------



29)role of scrum master
-----------------------



30)how to ensure 100% testing
-------------------------------




31)constructor



32)static









33)how to read the contents in a table in selenium
