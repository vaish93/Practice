`charles proxy ?- charles proxy is a network debuging tool.helps in understanding the content in your network call.
i.e request sent to server 
and data fetched from server


sanity testing ?- its a type of testing which is used to quickly evaluate the basic functionaly of the 
new software build is working correctly or not


smoke testing ?- also called as build verification testing or confidence testing which is used to check that the 
new software build is ready for the next testing phase

diff b/w smoke and sanity?
smoke testing verifies that the build is stable enouh for further testing

sanity testing used to check whether the specific functionality or 
component is working as expected after a change or modification

word = "vaishali"
word1 = word[slice(0,8,3)] #vsl   start , stop, increment value
print(word1)

#slice is a function to get the sequence of elements in the given range

 
memory allocation in python 
----------------------------
:- we can see the location of memory allocation of that value 
using id() function

eg: butter = 5
    id(butter)   #78901288789

alerts in selenium
-------------------

driver.switchto().alert.getText()
driver.switchto().alert.accept()
driver.switchto().alert().dismiss()


switch from one window to another
--------------------------------------

driver.switchto().window(window id)

driver.getwindowhandle() - current window
driver.getwindowhandles() - all open windows


assert and verify
-------------------

assert(hard assert)
if the condition fails , the execution will stop immediately and the test method will be failed

syntax : Assert.assertEquals(Actual,Expected)

verify (soft assert)

even if the condition fails , the execution will continue

syntax: softAssert.assertEquals(Actual,Expected)


what is ur criteria for Automation?say if you have 500 testcase , which one will you pick first?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
first we need to see the priority which ever testcase has high priority , we can filter that first
if incase all the testcase have the same priority , we can take the testcases which are covering the 
major functionalities

who is responsible for .exe file browsers or selenium?
browsers

driver.close()-
--------------
this command is used to close the current browser window which has focus.in case the browser has open only one window open
then this command will quit the entire browser session

driver.quit()-
----------------
driver.quit() is used to quit the whole browser session


how to handle multiple windows in selenium?
--------------------------------------------

getWindowHandle():- with this method , we can get the unique id of the current window

getWindowHandles() :- This will return a Set of string .this gives the window ids of all the open windows

switchto() :- this method is used to perform switch operations b/w windows
               driver.switchto().window(windowid)


Set<String> s1 = driver.getWindowHandles();

Iterator<String> i1 = s1.iterator();

while (i1.hasNext())
{
String child = i1.next();
  if(!mainwindow.equalsIgnoreCase(childwindow))
  {
    driver.switchto().window(child)
  }
}


maximize window:
-------------------
driver.manage().window().maximize();


IFRAMES
-------------:

its a kind of frame which is embedded in another webpage .this iframe is defined with a tag <iframe>

way to find frames in a webpage

driver.findelements(By.tagname("iframe")).size()

we can switch between frames using:
index,name or id, webelement

driver.switchto().frame()


explain about your project and roles and responsibilities:
----------------------------------------------------------------

hi,this is vaishali here, I am having 7+ years of IT Experience in testing.Majorily into Automation testing
my current roles and responsibilities were taking ownership of the platform module of our Application.will  regularly 
be a part of sprint planning which lasts for 30 days.interms of Automation , majorily involved into Test Automation
activities.we are having the existing framework and will be converting the manual test cases into Automated ones
Mobile automation Appium Selenium is current project


heap : heap data structure is used to represent the priority queue . in python , its available using heapq module

heapq.heapify(li) - This is used to convert iterable into heap

heapq.heappush(heap,ele) : this function is used to insert the elements to a heap

heapq.heappop(li): this will remove and return the smallest element from the heap

if you have given a requirement , what are the factors you consider for Automation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) scope - it is not practically possible to automate every testcase
1) i will be doing the manual testing for the testcase to check the stability of the functionality.
2) any dependancies in setting up the precondition or any challenges in test data
3)how frequently the testcase is going tto be used ie all the major functionalities should be covered first in Automation


how to find the total webelements present in a webpage?


driver.findelements(By.xpath("//*"))- returns a list containing all the webelements present in a webpage


Total number of text boxes in a webpage
------------------------------------------

driver.findelements(By.classname("")).size()


pom.xml
----------

Project Object Model

it comtains groupid , artifact id , jars, plugins, dependancies

name - project name 
url - project url

In jenkins , when the build triggers, where the execution will happen?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



what is a test plan
--------------------

test paln is the detailed document that has test strategies, objectives, schedule. estimation , deadline , 
resource required to complete the project



what is software testing lifecycle
----------------------------------

STLC is a systematic approach to test a software application and to ensure that the application is free from defects.

The main goal of STLC is to identify and document any defect or issue in the application as early as possible in the 
development process.

stages:

Test Planning
Test Analysis
Test Design
Test Environment setup
Test Execution
Test closure
Defect Retesting
