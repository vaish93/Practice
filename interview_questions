new software build is working correctly or not


smoke testing ?- also called as build verification testing or confidence testing which is used to check that the 
new software build is ready for the next testing phase

diff b/w smoke and sanity?
smoke testing verifies that the critical functionality is working fine or not.sanity testing verifies the new functionalities 
or bug fixes.


word = "vaishali"

alerts in selenium
-------------------

driver.switchto().alert.getText()
driver.switchto().alert.accept()
driver.switchto().alert().dismiss()


switch from one window to another
--------------------------------------

driver.switchto().window(window id)

driver.getwindowhandle() - current window
driver.getwindowhandles() - all open windows


assert and verify
-------------------

assert(hard assert)
if the condition fails , the execution will stop immediately and the test method will be failed

syntax : Assert.assertEquals(Actual,Expected)

verify (soft assert)

even if the condition fails , the execution will continue

syntax: softAssert.assertEquals(Actual,Expected)

how to handle multiple windows in selenium?
--------------------------------------------

getWindowHandle():- with this method , we can get the unique id of the current window

getWindowHandles() :- This will return a Set of string .this gives the window ids of all the open windows

switchto() :- this method is used to perform switch operations b/w windows
               driver.switchto().window(windowid)


Set<String> s1 = driver.getWindowHandles();

Iterator<String> i1 = s1.iterator();

while (i1.hasNext())
{
String child = i1.next();
  if(!mainwindow.equalsIgnoreCase(childwindow))
  {
    driver.switchto().window(child)
  }
}
